## How Cayenne Works

Cayenne is the world’s first drag and drop IoT project builder that empowers developers, designers and engineers to quickly prototype and share their connected device projects. Cayenne was designed to help users create Internet of Things prototypes and then bring them to production.

There are several major components in the platform:

- **Cayenne Mobile Apps** – Remotely monitor and control your IoT projects from the Android or iOS Apps.

- **Cayenne Online Dashboard** – Use customizable widgets to visualize data, set up rules, schedule events and more.
