## Overview
LoRa is a wireless technology developed to create the low-power, wide-area networks (LPWANs) required for machine-to-machine (M2M) and Internet of Things (IoT) applications. The technology offers a very compelling mix of long range, low power consumption and secure data transmission and is gaining significant traction in IoT networks being deployed by wireless network operators.

A network based on LoRa wireless technology can provide coverage that is greater in range compared to that of existing cellular networks. In fact, many mobile network operators have chosen to complement their existing cellular/wireless networks with a LPWAN based on LoRa technology because it is easy to plug into their existing infrastructure and also allows them to offer their customers a solution to serve more IoT battery-operated applications.

LoRa technology originally developed by Semtech is now utilized by the over 400 members of the LoRa Alliance, a non-profit organization focused on standardizing LoRa Technology for IoT/M2M and creating a strong ecosystem to scale the technology. To date, the alliance has developed a global LPWAN specification, known as LoRaWAN™, to help standardize LPWANs and foster the adoption of these networks to enable IoT, M2M, smart city, and industrial applications.

## How LoRaWAN™ works
LoRaWAN™ is a protocol specification based on the LoRa technology developed by the LoRa Alliance. LoRaWAN targets the basic needs of LoRa usage for IoT by providing Addressing, Routing and Security.

Topology of a LoRaWAN network consists of several elements.

* **End Nodes:** End nodes are elements such as sensors, which are usually remotely located.
* **Concentrator / Gateway:** Gateways are access points for for end nodes (e.g. sensors), aggregating data and communicating that data to a central network server via standard IP connections. Several gateways can be co-located in an area and can transparently share a single connection to the network server.
* **Network Server:** The LoRa Network Server acts to eliminate duplicate packets, manages security and data rates.
* **Application Server:** Application Servers manage payload security and performs analysis to utilize sensor data. Cayenne operates as an Application Server.

## About DevEUIs

LoRa devices have a unique identifier (DevEUI) that is assigned to the device by the chip manufacturer. This identifier is used to uniquely identify the device on the network. Cayenne will need to know the DevEUI for your device, regardless of whether it is already registered, or if the device needs to be activated for the first time.

## Cayenne Low Power Payload

### Overview

The Cayenne Low Power Payload (LPP) provides a convenient and easy way to send data over LPWAN networks such as LoRaWAN.  The Cayenne LPP is compliant with the payload size restriction, which can be lowered down to 11 bytes, and allows the device to send multiple sensor data at one time.  

Additionally, the Cayenne LPP allows the device to send different sensor data in different frames. In order to do that, each sensor data must be prefixed with two bytes:

- **Data Channel:** Uniquely identifies each sensor in the device across frames, eg. “indoor sensor”
- **Data Type:** Identifies the data type in the frame, eg. “temperature”.

### Payload structure

### Data Types

Data Types conform to the IPSO Alliance Smart Objects Guidelines, which identifies each data type with an “Object ID”.  However, as shown below, a conversion is made to fit the Object ID into a single byte.

```
LPP_DATA_TYPE = IPSO_OBJECT_ID - 3200
```

Each data type can use 1 or more bytes to send the data according to the following table.

### IPSO Smart Objects Reference

For full information about IPSO Smart Objects, see <a href="http://www.ipso-alliance.org/" target="_blank">http://www.ipso-alliance.org/</a>.

```
IPSO Smart Objects are based on the object model specified in OMA LightWeight M2M [1] Chapter 6, 
Identifiers and Resources.
					
An IPSO Smart Object is a specified collection of reusable resources (See Table 2, Reusable Resources) 
that has a well-known object ID (See Table 1, Smart Objects) and which represents a particular type of 
physical sensor, actuator, connected object or other data source. The reusable resources,which make up 
the Smart Object, represent static and dynamic properties of the connected physical object and the 
embedded software contained therein.
					
This document defines a set of IPSO Smart Objects, which conform to the OMA LWM2MObject Model, and 
which can be used as data objects, or web objects, to represent common sensors, actuators, and data 
sources.
					
Although OMA LWM2M is based on the IETF CoAP [2] protocol, these objects may be used with other 
transport protocols (e.g. HTTP [3] with REST [4]) by supporting the Content-Types and access methods 
defined in [1]. 
```

The following section provides information extracted from the IPSO Smart Objects specifications.  It includes all of the Data Types (object ID) that can be used with Cayenne LPP. **Therefore, the current implementation is limited to the data types listed in the [Data Types section](#lora-cayenne-low-power-payload-data-types).**

## Using a public network
Using a public LoRa network is the easiest way to get started using LoRa. In order to get started using a public LoRa network, you will want to first verify that yours sensors will be covered by an appropriate Network Operator. Once you know which network operator you will connect with, you can purchase devices that work on that network. You will then need an account with that operator so that you can add your devices to the network.

In order to activate a LoRa device on a network, you will need to have an account with that network. Using Cayenne, you will not need your account information if the device has already been registered on the network. If you wish to use Cayenne to help activate the device on the network, however, you will need your account information handy so that you can provide this information in order to authenticate with the network and activate the device.

Cayenne currently supports the following LoRa networks. The list of networks that work with Cayenne will keep growing.

*   [Actility](#lora-actility)
*   [Kerlink](#lora-kerlink-network)

**Using Actility with Cayenne**

Cayenne makes it easy to use your LoRa device and the Actility network. You will need to:

1. [Create / Log into your account on Actility's ThingPark portal](#lora-actility-create-account)
2. [Setup gateway device](#lora-actility-setup-gateway-device)
3. [Create Cayenne Routing Profile](#lora-actility-create-cayenne-routing-profile)
4. [Register your device on the ThingPark portal](#lora-actility-manually-register-device)
5. [Program/Flash your device](#lora-actility-programming-the-device)
6. [Add your device to your Cayenne dashboard](#lora-actility-add-device-to-cayenne)

We will walk you through these steps in the following sections.


### Create account

To create your ThingPark account, visit the <a href="https://partners.thingpark.com/en" target="_blank">Actility ThingPark Partner's Portal</a> and click on **Try** or the <a href="https://partners.thingpark.com/explorer/register" target="_blank">Create free account</a> button to begin the process of creating your account.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170410102508/Actility-account-creation-highlight.png" width="600" height="338" alt="ThingPark create account link"><br/><br/></p>

Once your account has been created, you can <a href="https://partners.thingpark.com/en/user/login" target="_blank">log into your account</a> from the Partner portal.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170410103255/Actility-login-link.png" width="600" height="168" alt="ThingPark account login link"><br/><br/></p>

After logging into your account you will see the ThingPark Partner dashboard page.

To access this screen, open the **side menu** and select the **Device Manager** link.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170410103431/ThingPark-partner-dashboard-with-highlight.png" width="600" height="376" alt="ThingPark dashboard with menu highlight"><br/><br/></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170410103645/ThingPark-portal-side-menu.png" width="323" height="877" alt="Menu with device link highlght"><br/><br/></p>

After selecting the **Device Manager** link, your *Device Manager* screen will open.

_Tip: Take note of which server your account is using. For most people this will probably be **dev1.thingpark.com**. You will need to know which server you are using later when adding a device to Cayenne._

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170410104008/ThingPark-dev-server-with-highlight.png" width="600" height="393" alt="ThingPark device dashboard"><br/><br/></p>

### Setup gateway device

In order for your LoRa devices to connect to the Actility network, you must have purchased and configured a gateway device. When using the Actility network, we recommend that you purchase and configure one of the following gateway devices:

+ For use in the European Union, we recommend the **Multitech Conduit EU868**
   + You can purchase a <a href="https://market.thingpark.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=+eu868+gateway" target="_blank">Multitech Conduit EU868 here</a>
+ For use in the United States of America, we recommend the **Multitech Conduit US915**
   + You can purchase a <a href="https://market.thingpark.com/catalogsearch/result/?q=US915" target="_blank">Multitech Conduit US915 here</a>
   
**Be sure that you have an appropriate Actility gateway configured and working before continuing. Your devices will not be able to properly function without your gateway device in place.**


### Create Cayenne Routing Profile

<p style="text-align:center"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rpZo-GKd7mY" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

In order for data from your device to reach Cayenne, you must create an **Application Server** that points to Cayenne in the Actility portal. You will also need to add an **AS Routing Profile** that uses this server. You only need to perform this step once. Any devices that you wish to add to Cayenne will then need to be configured to use the routing profile or Cayenne will not receive their data.

Begin by creating the **Application Server**. From the device manager, select the **Application Servers** entry and from the screen that appears, click on the **Create** button to begin creating a new server.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20170119090424/Actility-Routing-Profile-1-App-Server.png" width="600" height="358" alt="Create new app server highlight"><br/><br/></p>

Give the new entry an appropriate name that you can refer to later, such as "Cayenne". After proceeding, you will see the *Application Server* screen where you can enter in information for the application server. From this screen, click on the **Add** button located in the **Add a route** section.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20170119090427/Actility-Routing-Profile-2-App-Server-Route.png" width="600" height="360" alt="Add new route button highlight"><br/><br/></p>

In the *Route* section that gets added to the screen, click on the **Add** button to start adding a destination.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20170119090428/Actility-Routing-Profile-2.5-App-Server-Route.png" width="600" height="361" alt="Destintation Add button highlight"><br/><br/></p>

In the *Add Destination* dialog that appears, enter in the Cayenne Actility URL and then click on the **Add** button to save your changes.

```
https://lora.mydevices.com/v1/networks/actility/uplink
```

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170412073138/Create-Routing-Profile-add-destination.png" width="600" height="249" alt="Paste in Cayenne destination url"><br/><br/></p>

Now that the Application Server has been setup, we need to create the AS Routing Profile. To create this profile select the **AS routing profiles** entry on the portal. From the screen that appears, click on the **Create** button to begin creating a new profile.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20170119090432/Actility-Routing-Profile-4-Profile-main.png" width="600" height="359" alt="Create new profile highlight"><br/><br/></p>

Give your profile an appropriate name, such as "Cayenne" so that you can refer to it later when you configure your devices. After giving your profile a name, you will see the *AS Routing Profile* screen. Click on the **Add** button located in the **Destinations** section.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20170119090433/Actility-Routing-Profile-5-Profile-new.png" width="600" height="360" alt="Add destination button highlight"><br/><br/></p>

From the *Add Destinations* dialog that appears, be sure that the **Type** dropdown is set to *Application Server*. In the **Destinations** dropdown, be sure to select the Application Server you created earlier for Cayenne.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20170119090435/Actility-Routing-Profile-6-Profile-destination.png" width="600" height="268" alt="Select app server in profile"><br/><br/></p>

After saving your changes, you will be returned to the previous screen. Be sure to click on the **Save** button to save the changes to your profile. You may now continue with creating a device that uses this profile.


### Manually register device

Before you can use your LoRa device on the Actility network, it must be registered on the network. The following information will help guide you through this process using Actility's ThingPark portal and the *Device Manager* screen.

Once your device has been created, continue by making sure that your device has been [programmed/flashed](#lora-actility-programming-the-device).

###  Programming the device

Some devices will come from your device supplier preprogrammed and ready to be used immediately. Other devices will require you to program the device manually. If your device is preprogrammed, it can now be deployed and connected to the network for usage.

If your device needs to be programmed, you should now proceed with programming/flashing the device. Because this process is different for each device, you should refer to the instructions for your device for any specific information you need to perform this step. If you need help, you can refer to the [Supported devices section](#supported-hardware-lora-technology-devices) where you will find Product page, Datasheet and User Guides for your device.

**NOTE: Be sure that your device is programmed and properly connected to the network at this time. Only after your device is programmed, online and properly forwarding data should you proceed with adding your device to Cayenne.**


### Add device to Cayenne

<p style="text-align:center"><iframe width="480" height="270" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u6QuVJCUTo4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></p>

Once your device has been registered, programmed, configured to forward data to Cayenne and is online, you can proceed with adding the device in Cayenne so that it appears in your dashboard.

From the Cayenne Dashboard, click **Add New** > **Device / Widget**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160601122359/AddNew.jpg" width="260" height="252" alt="Actility"><br/><br/></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://www.mydevices.com/cayenne/uploads/Add-LoRa-device-Actility-menu.png" width="600" height="363" alt="Actility"><br/><br/></p>

After selecting the device that you wish to add, settings for that device will appear. In the following section, we’ll walk you through the settings needed for adding a previously registered device.

#### Already Registered

If your device has been previously registered on the Actility network, it can be quickly & easily added to Cayenne. Once added, your device and all of its sensors will appear in your dashboard.

**Items you will need:**

1.  Which [LoRa technology device](#lora-actility-supported-devices) is being added?
2.  Your device will need to have been previously registered on the network. Refer to [Manual device registration](#lora-actility-manually-register-device) if you need help with manually registering your device on a network.
3.  What is the unique [DevEUI](#lora-about-deveuis) for the device being added?
4.  Which Actility ThingPark Server are you using?
5.  Your Actility ThingPark Email and ThingPark Password.

To see how easy it is, let’s walk through an example of connecting an [Adeunis LoRa Pulse](#supported-hardware-lora-devices-adeunis-adeunis-pulse) which was previously registered under an [Actility account](#lora-actility-create-account).

**1\. Choose the Network** <br/>
Make sure the **Actility** network is selected in the list of Networks.'

**3\. Enter Settings & Add device**

In order to add the device, Cayenne needs to know some information about the device and how it will be shown on the dashboard.

1.  Give the device a name. In our case, we’ll enter “LoRa Pulse” in the **Name** field.
2.  Enter the [DevEUI](#lora-about-deveuis) for this device into the **DevEUI** field.
3.  Our device has been previously manually registered with Actility. Select “Already Registered” in the **Activation Mode** field.
4.  From the **ThingPark Server** field, be sure to select the correct environment that you are using.

    *TIP: If you don't find your ThingPark environment in the dropdown, please ask Actility for your **ThingPark DX Profile**, and manually enter it. It should be suffixed with `-api` such as `mycompany-api`.*

5.  Enter your **ThingPark Email** and **ThingPark Password** into the corresponding fields.
6.  Click **Add device**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/20170118131239/Add-Device-Actility-LoRa-Pulse-already-registered2.png" width="600" height="363" alt="Actility"><br/><br/></p>

The Pulse has been added to your dashboard and Cayenne will automatically add widgets for the sensors on the device. You can now [track the location](#features-asset-tracking) of your device as well as examine the current status of the water, gas, electricity & heat sensors on the device.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://www.mydevices.com/cayenne/uploads/LoRa-dashboard.png" width="600" height="363" alt="Actility"><br/><br/></p>


### Actility Device Profiles

When setting up your device on Actility's ThingPark portal, you must select the correct **Device Profile** for your device. Below are some guidelines on which profile to select.

+ For devices used in European Union:
  + Select the Profile **LoRaWAN 1.0 class A - Rx2-SF12**
+ For devices use in United States of America:
  + Select the Profile **LoRaWAN 1.0 class A -US- Rx2-SF12**
+ Exceptions to the above:
  + If you are using the **NKE Watteco SmartPlug**, use the class C version of above configs depending on which region you are in.

    For example, with the SmartPlug being used in the US, select **LoRaWAN 1.0 class C (-US-) Rx2-SF12**
    And in the EU, select **LoRaWAN 1.0 class C - Rx2-SF12**


## Kerlink Network

**About Kerlink**

Kerlink specialises in network solutions for the Internet of Things (IoT). Its mission is to provide its clients – telecom
carriers, businesses and public authorities – with network solutions (equipment, software and services) dedicated to
the Internet of Things.

**Using Kerlink with Cayenne**

Cayenne makes it easy to use your LoRa device and the Kerlink network. You will need to:

1. [Setup gateway device](#lora-kerlink-network-setup-gateway-device)
2. [Setup traffic forwarding to Cayenne](#lora-kerlink-network-setup-traffic-forwarding-to-cayenne)
3. [Manually register device](#lora-kerlink-network-manually-register-device)
4. [Program/Flash your device](#lora-kerlink-network-programming-the-device)
5. [Add your device to your Cayenne dashboard](#lora-kerlink-network-add-device-to-cayenne)

We will walk you through these steps in the following sections.


### Setup gateway device

In order for your LoRa technology devices to connect to the Kerlink network, you must have purchased and configured a gateway device. Kerlink supports <a href="http://www.kerlink.fr/en/products" target="_blank">several different gateway devices</a>.

- **NOTE:** At this time, connection between Kerlink and Cayenne is only supported with the <a href="http://www.kerlink.fr/en/products/lora-iot-station-2/wirma-station-spn" target="_blank">Kerlink Wirnet Station SPN</a>.

**Be sure that you have your gateway configured and working before continuing. Your devices will not be able to properly function without your gateway device in place.**

#### Connect to your gateway device

Adding LoRa devices and forwarding their data to Cayenne must be configured on the Kerlink gateway device. You can do so using the gateway's web interface.

**Log into the gateway device.**

Connect with your browser to the URL / IP Address of your gateway device.

*TIP: If needed you can use a network scanner, such as the <a href="https://www.fing.io/#fingapp" target="_blank">Fing app</a> to identify devices on your network.*

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420150425/Kerlink-IP-Address-example.png" width="365" height="85" alt="Example enter IP address in browser"><br/><br/></p>

**Possible security warning seen on connection**

When connecting to your gateway device, you may find that your web browser complains about the connection not being secure. Depending upon which browser you are using and its security settings, you may need <a href="http://www.inmotionhosting.com/support/website/ssl/self-signed-ssl-certificate-warning" target="_blank">to take actions to proceed</a> and access the gateway content.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420150219/Kerlink-security-warning.png" width="660" height="392" alt="Example security warning from Chrome"><br/><br/></p>

**Connected to gateway device**

As soon as you are connected to the gateway device, you will see the landing screen for your device. You can proceed with configuring the gateway to forward data to Cayenne.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420150602/Kerlink-landing-screen.png" width="660" height="414" alt="Kerlink SPN landing screen"><br/><br/></p>


### Setup traffic forwarding to Cayenne

In order for data from your devices to reach Cayenne, you must configure your gateway device to forward data to Cayenne. You will need to perform this step on each Kerlink gateway device. Once logged into your Kerlink gateway interface, click on the **HTTP transmitter** option located in the **Configuration** section.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420151016/Kerlink-landing-screen-data-forward-highlight.png" width="660" height="414" alt="device routing feed screen"><br/><br/></p>

In the *HTTP transmitter* screen that appears, enter in the following information:

1. Click on the **Enable** checkbox to enable the fields shown here.
2. In the **Address** field enter in the uplink URL for the Kerlink network.

    ```
    https://lora.mydevices.com/v1/networks/kerlink/uplink/
    ```

3. Click **Save** to save the changes.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420150904/Kerlink-Cayenne-forwarding.png" width="660" height="297" alt="HTTP Transmitter configured for Cayenne"><br/><br/></p>

Your gateway is now configured to forward data to Cayenne. You can now proceed with adding devices.


### Manually register device

Before you can use your device on the Kerlink network, it must be registered on the network. To accomplish this, devices can be added to the gateway under what Kerlink calls "Fleet devices". The following information will help guide you through this process.

Click on the **Fleet** option located near the top of the gateway menu. The *Fleet* screen appears and from here you can add devices.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420151837/Kerlink-landing-screen-fleet-highlight.png" width="660" height="414" alt="Landing screen with fleet option highlighted"><br/><br/></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420152455/Kerlink-fleet-devices-landing.png" width="660" height="333" alt="Fleet devices default screen"><br/><br/></p>

Kerlink supports two activation modes (OTAA, ABP). In most cases, you will want to select Over the Air Activation (OTAA). Let’s cover the information needed for both methods.

- [Over the Air Activation (OTAA)](#lora-kerlink-manually-register-device-over-the-air-activation-otaa)
- [Activation By Personalization (ABP)](#lora-kerlink-manually-register-device-activation-by-personalization-abp)

#### Over the Air Activation (OTAA)

Below you will find notes on the fields seen for OTAA and specific notes as they relate to what needs to be selected in order to work with Cayenne.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420153101/Kerlink-OTAA-activation.png" width="660" height="111" alt="Kerlink OTAA activation options"><br/><br/></p>

+ **Dev EUI:** Enter the DevEUI for your device. This ID should come with the information included with your device, or can be found in the device configuration.

+ **App EUI:** Enter the AppEUI. The AppEUI is a global application ID that uniquely identifies the application provider (i.e., owner) of the device.

    *TIP: If you do not have an Applicate EUI, you can create one yourself. It must be a unique string composed of 16 alphanumeric characters.*

+ **App key:** Enter the Appkey. The AppKey is a key specific for the end-device that is assigned by the application owner to the end-device and most likely derived from an application-specific root key exclusively known to and under the control of the application provider.

    *TIP: If you do not have an Applicate key, you can create one yourself. It must be a unique string composed of 32 alphanumeric characters.*

+ **Class C:** Select whether or not your device operates in continuous listening mode. If not, leave this option unselected.

    *TIP: Class C is a continuous listening mode making sense for devices that are connected to the electrical network. In this mode the network can at anytime transmit downlink message to the device. An example of such a device is the [NKE Watteco SmartPlug](#supported-hardware-lora-technology-devices-nke-watteco-nke-watteco-smart-plug).*
	
After filling in the fields for you device, click on the **Add** button to add the device. Once added, you will see your new device listed on the *Fleet* screen.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420154546/Kerlink-device-added.png" width="600" height="333" alt="Kerlink fleet device added"><br/><br/></p>

Once your device has been created, continue by making sure that your device has been [programmed/flashed](#lora-kerlink-programming-the-device).

#### Activation By Personalization (ABP)

Below you will find notes on the fields seen for ABP and specific notes as they relate to what needs to be selected in order to work with Cayenne.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420153100/Kerlink-ABP-activation.png" width="660" height="98" alt="Kerlink ABP activation options"><br/><br/></p>

+ **Dev Addr:** When using ABP, you will need to manually enter the hardware address here.

    **NOTE:** Kerlink's ABP fields does not ask you to enter the **Dev EUI** for the device. In order to properly add a device using ABP in Cayenne, an extra step is needed. Be sure to refer to the [Add your device to your Cayenne dashboard](#lora-kerlink-network-add-device-to-cayenne) section in order to make sure that your device is properly added to Cayenne.

+ **NwkSKey:** Enter the Network Session Key. The NwkSKey is a network session key specific for the end-device. It is used by both the network server and the end-device to calculate and verify the MIC (message integrity code) of all data messages to ensure data integrity. It is further used to encrypt and decrypt the payload field of a MAC only data messages.

+ **AppSKey:** Enter the Application Session Key. The AppSKey is an application session key specific for the end-device. It is used by both the network server and the end-device to encrypt and decrypt the payload field of application-specific data messages.

+ **Class C:** Select whether or not your device operates in continuous listening mode. If not, leave this option unselected.

    *TIP: Class C is a continuous listening mode making sense for devices that are connected to the electrical network. In this mode the network can at anytime transmit downlink message to the device. An example of such a device is the [NKE Watteco SmartPlug](#supported-hardware-lora-technology-devices-nke-watteco-nke-watteco-smart-plug).*
	
After filling in the fields for you device, click on the **Add** button to add the device. Once added, you will see your new device listed on the *Fleet* screen.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420154546/Kerlink-device-added.png" width="600" height="333" alt="Kerlink fleet device added"><br/><br/></p>

Once your device has been created, continue by making sure that your device has been [programmed/flashed](#lora-kerlink-programming-the-device).

###  Programming the device

Some devices will come from your device supplier preprogrammed and ready to be used immediately. Other devices will require you to program the device manually. If your device is preprogrammed, it can now be deployed and connected to the network for usage.

If your device needs to be programmed, you should now proceed with programming/flashing the device. Because this process is different for each device, you should refer to the instructions for your device for any specific information you need to perform this step. If you need help, you can refer to the [Supported devices section](#supported-hardware-lora-technology-devices) where you will find Product page, Datasheet and User Guides for your device.

**NOTE: Be sure that your device is programmed and properly connected to the network at this time. Only after your device is programmed, online and properly forwarding data should you proceed with adding your device to Cayenne.**

### Add device to Cayenne

Once your device has been registered, programmed, configured to forward data to Cayenne and is online, you can proceed with adding the device in Cayenne so that it appears in your dashboard.

From the Cayenne Dashboard, click **Add New** > **Device / Widget**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160601122359/AddNew.jpg" width="260" height="252" alt="Cayenne Add New menu"><br/><br/></p>

From the list of devices & widgets that appears, select the **LoRa** category and then the **Kerlink** Network option to view a list of supported devices.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420160324/Cayenne-Kerlink-network-list.png" width="660" height="413" alt="Cayenne showing supported Kerlink devices"><br/><br/></p>

After selecting the device that you wish to add, settings for that device will appear. In the following section, we’ll walk you through the settings needed for adding a previously registered device.

#### Already Registered

If your device has been previously registered on the Kerlink network, it can be quickly & easily added to Cayenne. Once added, your device and all of its sensors will appear in your dashboard.

**Items you will need:**

1. Which [LoRa technology device](#lora-kerlink-network-supported-devices) is being added?
2. Your device will need to have been previously registered on the network. Refer to [Manual device registration](#lora-kerlink-network-manually-register-device) if you need help with manually registering your device on a network.
3. What is the unique [DevEUI](#lora-about-deveuis) for the device being added?

To see how easy it is, let’s walk through an example of connecting an [Adeunis Pulse](#supported-hardware-lora-devices-adeunis-adeunis-pulse) which was [previously registered](#lora-kerlink-network-manually-register-device) on our Kerlink gateway device.

**1\. Choose the Network**

Make sure the **Kerlink** network is selected in the list of LoRaWAN Networks.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420160324/Cayenne-Kerlink-network-list.png" width="660" height="413" alt="Cayenne showing supported Kerlink devices"><br/><br/></p>

**2\. Select the Device**

Select your device from among the list supported the Kerlink network devices. In this case, we’ll select the **Adeunis Pulse**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170421081221/Cayenne-Kerlink-Pulse-selected2.png" width="660" height="413" alt="Kerlink with Pulse device highlight"><br/><br/></p>

**3\. Enter Settings & Add device**

In order to add the device, Cayenne needs to know some information about the device and how it will be shown on the dashboard.

1. Give the device a name. In our case, we’ll enter “LoRa Pulse” in the **Name** field.
2. Enter the [DevEUI](#lora-about-deveuis) for this device into the **DevEUI** field.

    **NOTE: If your device was configured for Activation By Personalization (ABP), you will need to take a special step here -** Cayenne asks for the DevEUI but this information is not currently provided with Kerlink and ABP. To work around this issue, enter in 8 zeros (00000000) followed by the **Dev Addr** used during the [register device with ABP step](#lora-kerlink-network-manually-register-device-activation-by-personalization-abp) on the gateway. Without performing this step, your ABP device will not work with Cayenne. This step is not necessary when using OTAA.
    
    <p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170421081852/Cayenne-Kerlink-Pulse-device-settings-ABP-highlight2.png" width="362" height="423" alt="Preceed Dev Addr with 8 zeros in Cayenne"><br/><br/></p>

3. Our device has been previously manually registered with the Kerlink network. Make sure “Already Registered” is selected in the **Activation Mode** field.
4. Click **Add device**.

### Manually register device

Before you can use your LoRa device on the Objenious network, it must be registered on the network. The following information will help guide you through this process using Objenious's SPOT portal and the *CAPTEURS* screen.

**Import Devices**

To get started with adding new devices, click on the **CAPTEURS** link in the side menu shown on the SPOT dashboard. From the screen that appears, click on the **IMPORTER DES CAPTEURS** button.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170516152817/Objenius-dashboard-capteurs-highlight.png" width="660" height="585" alt="Capteurs button highlight"><br/><br/></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170516153229/Objenious-gestion-des-capteurs-import-highlight.png" width="660" height="333" alt="Import button highlight"><br/><br/></p>

In order to import devices into Objenious, you will need to download and fill in a template file. Download the template by clicking on the **Téléchargez le template** button. Fill in the required information for the devices that you wish to import and **save** the template.

*Note: Take note of which __Groupe (code)__ you specify your devices get imported to. Later when you [setup data forwarding to Cayenne](#lora-objenious-network-setup-device-forwarding-to-cayenne), you will need to do so for each group of devices you want to forward data.*

*Note: If you need more information on this step, or run into trouble importing your devices, you may wish to refer to Objenious' <a href="https://spot.objenious.com/assets/documents/faq/faq.pdf?v1" target="_blank">FAQ document (FRENCH)</a> that contains a wealth of helpful information.*

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170516153519/Objenius-import-devices-template-highlight.png" width="660" height="343" alt="Import screen with template button highlighted"><br/><br/></p>

To complete importing your devices, click on **CHOISIR UN FICHIER** and browse to the template file that contains the devices you wish to importn. Click on the **IMPORTER** button and then the **ACCEPTER** button.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170516153729/Objenius-import-upload-template-highlight.png" width="660" height="214" alt="Import screen with template ready to import"><br/><br/></p>

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170516153813/Objenius-import-confirmation-dialog.png" width="660" height="384" alt="Import screen popup"><br/><br/></p>

*Note: You will see the status of your device import and any errors down below in the history section on the Import screen. If you run into any errors, you can expand the details for that import attempt and then try again.*

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170516153950/Objenius-import-error-highlight.png" width="660" height="241" alt="Import screen with import history showing error expanded"><br/><br/></p>

Once your devices have been imported, they should appear on the *GESTION DES CAPTEURS* screen.

**Note:** that it can take up to 48 hours for newly imported devices to be activated on Objenious. In the meantime, you will see your device shown in the list of devices, but you will see an activation error shown in the status (STATUT) field. Once your device is ready to be used, you will see a green *EN ACTIVITÉ* status shown next to your device.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170516154145/Objenious-gestion-des-capteurs-activated-device.png" width="660" height="333" alt="Devices screen with activated device highlight"><br/><br/></p>

Once your device has been imported and is ready to be used, you can proceed with setting up data forwarding to Cayenne.

### Setup device forwarding to Cayenne

In order for Cayenne to be able to able to receive your device’s information, you will need to setup forwarding. When devices are imported into Objenious, they are imported into a group (Groupe). This setup will need to be performed once for each group of devices in your account.

To perform this step, expand the **CONFIGURATION** option in the side menu and select **Scénarios et alertes**. On the *SCÉNARIOS ALERTES* screen that appears, click on the **CRÉER UN SCÉNARIO** button to begin creating a new scenario.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170516154308/Objenius-scenarios-create-highlight.png" width="660" height="306" alt="Scenarios screen with create highlight"><br/><br/></p>

On the *CHOIX DU SCÉNARIO* page that appears, scroll down and select the HTTP Push Route (**ROUTAGE**) option. Then click on the **SUIVANT** button to continue to the next step.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170516154549/Objenius-route-highlight.png" width="660" height="407" alt="HTTP Push Routage option highlight"><br/><br/></p>

On the Parameters screen (*PARAMÉTRAGE DU SCÉNARIO*), make the following choices:

- Enter a name for the route in the name (**NOM DU SCENARIO**) field, such as ``Cayenne Forward``.
- From the group (**GROUPE**) field, select which group of devices you want this rule to apply. *In the example shown here, our group is named **MyDevices**. Yours will be named differently.*
- From the list of device types (**TYPE DE CAPTEUR**) select All (**TOUS**).

    <p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170516154723/Objenius-route-parameters-1.png" width="660" height="450" alt="Parameters entered so far"><br/><br/></p>
- In the destination URL field (**ENVOI D'UNE REQUÊTE HTTP**) enter in Cayenne's Objenious uplink URL.

    ```
    https://lora.mydevices.com/v1/networks/objenious/uplink
    ```
- Under **CONTENU** be sure to select the **MESSAGE** option. This is required so that Cayenne receives the entire payload data and not just decoded values.
- Finally, click on the create scenario (**Créer le scénario**) button to complete the creation.

    <p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170516154724/Objenius-route-parameters-2.png" width="660" height="598" alt="Parameters showing last options and create highlight"><br/><br/></p>

You will then see your completed route shown on the *SCÉNARIOS ALERTES* screen. Your group is now configured to forward data to Cayenne. You can now proceed with adding your devices in Cayenne.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170516154934/Objenius-scenarios.png" width="660" height="306" alt="Scenarios screen with Cayenne Forward created"><br/><br/></p>

### Add device to Cayenne

Once your device has been registered, programmed, configured to forward data to Cayenne and is online, you can proceed with adding the device in Cayenne so that it appears in your dashboard.

From the Cayenne Dashboard, click **Add New** > **Device / Widget**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160601122359/AddNew.jpg" width="260" height="252" alt="Cayenne Add New menu"><br/><br/></p>

From the list of devices & widgets that appears, select the **LoRa** category and then **Objenious** option to view a list of supported devices.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170516155015/Cayenne-Objenious-network-list.png" width="660" height="413" alt="Cayenne showing list of Objenious devices"><br/><br/></p>

After selecting the device that you wish to add, settings for that device will appear. In the following section, we’ll walk you through the settings needed for adding a previously registered device.

#### Already Registered

If your device has been previously registered on Objenious, it can be quickly & easily added to Cayenne. Once added, your device and all of its sensors will appear in your dashboard.

**Items you will need:**

1. Which [LoRa technology device](#lora-the-things-network-supported-devices) is being added?
2. Your device will need to have been previously registered on the network. Refer to [Manual device registration](#lora-objenious-network-manually-register-device) if you need help with manually registering your device on the network.
3. What is the unique [DevEUI](#lora-about-deveuis) for the device being added?

To see how easy it is, let’s walk through an example of connecting an [Adeunis Pulse](#supported-hardware-lora-devices-adeunis-adeunis-pulse) which was previously registered under a [Objenious account](#lora-objenious-network-create-account).

**1\. Choose the Network**

Make sure **Objenious** is selected in the list of Networks.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170516155015/Cayenne-Objenious-network-list.png" width="660" height="413" alt="Cayenne showing list of Objenious devices"><br/><br/></p>

**2\. Select the Device**

Select your device from among the list supported Objenious devices. In this case, we’ll select the **Adeunis Pulse**.

## OrbiWise Network

**About OrbiWise**

OrbiWise is a leading solution provider for Low-Power Wide–Area wireless Networks optimized for connected objects based on LoRa(TM) technology.

**Using OrbiWise with Cayenne**

Cayenne makes it easy to use your LoRa device and the OrbiWise network. You will need to:

1. [Create / Log into your account on the OrbiWise portal](#lora-orbiwise-network-create-account)
2. [Setup gateway device](#lora-orbiwise-network-setup-gateway-device)
3. [Register your device on the Orbiwise portal](#lora-orbiwise-network-manual-register-device)
4. [Setup traffic forwarding to Cayenne](#lora-orbiwise-network-setup-device-forwarding-to-cayenne)
5. [Program/Flash your device](#lora-orbiwise-network-programming-the-device)
6. [Add your device to your Cayenne dashboard](#lora-orbiwise-network-add-device-to-cayenne)

We will walk you through these steps in the following sections.


### Create account

To get an account with OrbiWise, you will need to work directly with OrbiWise. Accounts are not created manually through any sign up process.

### Setup gateway device

In order for your LoRa technology devices to connect to the OrbiWise network, you should purchase and configure a gateway device. Currently, you will obtain and use a <a href="http://www.tektelic.com/portfolio/" target="_blank">Tektelic gateway</a> that has been configured for OrbiWise and Cayenne. OrbiWise will perform this configuration for you. Since your gateway will be preconfigured to work with Cayenne, you will not need to configure any Cayenne-specific data forwarding for each device connected to that gateway.

**Be sure that your devices are covered by an appropriate OrbiWise gateway, including having the gateway configured and working for Cayenne, before continuing. Your devices will not be able to properly function without your gateway device in place.**

#### Register new gateway device

If you obtain your gateway from OrbiWise, your gateway may already be configured and registered. In such instances, you probably do not need to register your device prior to using it. If, however, you need to register your device you can do so using your OrbiWise portal.

To view the gateways under your account, log into your customer-specific OrbiWise portal and select **My Gateways** > **List Of Gateways**. You will then see the current list of gateways for your account.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://www.mydevices.com/cayenne/uploads/OrbiWise-My-Gateways-menu.png" width="600" height="257" alt="OrbiWise gateway screen and menu"><br/><br/></p>

To register a new gateway, click on the **Add Gateway** button and the *Add Gateway* dialog appears. The only information you'll need is the **Gateway ID** for the gateway you'll be adding. Enter this ID into the **Gateway ID** field and click **Add Gateway** to add your gateway.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://www.mydevices.com/cayenne/uploads/OrbiWise-Add-Gateway.png" width="600" height="192" alt="OrbiWise add gateway dialog"><br/><br/></p>


### Manual register device

Before you can use your device on the OrbiWise network, it must be registered on the network using the OrbiWise portal. The following information will help guide you through this process.

**Register new device**

Start by going to your customer-specific OrbiWise portal and logging into your account. Once logged in, you can proceed with registering a new device. From the **My Devices** menu, select **List of Devices** and the *My Devices* screen appears.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://www.mydevices.com/cayenne/uploads/OrbiWise-My-Devices-menu.png" width="600" height="248" alt="Orbiwise add device menu"><br/><br/></p>

From the *My Devices* screen, click on the **Add Device** button to begin the process of adding a new device. The **Add New Device** dialog appears, allowing you to enter in the required information to add and activate your device. Depending upon the **Registration type** that you will be using ([Join Procedure](#lora-orbiwise-network-manual-register-device-join-procedure) or [Presonalized](#lora-orbiwise-network-manual-register-device-presonalized)), the information you need to provide will be slightly different.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://www.mydevices.com/cayenne/uploads/OrbiWise-Add-new-device-Join-Procedure.png" width="600" height="259" alt="Orbiwise OTA"><br/><br/></p>

#### Join Procedure

After selecting the **Registration type** > **Join Procedure** option, the list of fields will update to show you required fields needed for **Join Procedure** registration. This registration process is similar to *Over the Air Activation* that may see with other LoRa networks. You will need to fill in all require fields to register & activate your device with OrbiWise. Below you will find notes on the fields seen for **Join Procedure** registration and specific notes as they relate to what needs to be selected in order to work with Cayenne.

+ **Device EUI:** Enter the **DevEUI** for your device. This ID should come with the information included with your device, or can be found in the device configuration.
+ **Application EUI:** Enter the **AppEUI**. The AppEUI is a global application ID that uniquely identifies the application provider (i.e., owner) of the device.

   _NOTE: The OrbiWise portal is currently under active development. Currently there is a bug in the OrbiWise portal wherein although the **AppEUI** field is required for *Join Procedure* registration, this field may not be present on the dialog. To work around this, perform the following steps:_
   1. _First select the **Registration type** > **Personalized** option to temporarily display the fields for the **Personalized** registration mode._
   2. _Enter in the **AppEUI** information into the field that *does* appear there. You only need to enter in the AppEUI here._
   3. _Then return to the **Join Precedure** tab by clicking back on **Join Procedure**._
   4. _You can then continue with registering using the **Join Procedure** registration fields._
+ **Comment:** Optional. We recommend you enter in the device name, or a description so that you can easily refer to it on the OrbiWise dashboard.
+ Complete the device registration by clicking the **Add Device** button.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://www.mydevices.com/cayenne/uploads/OrbiWise-Add-new-device-Join-Procedure.png" width="600" height="259" alt="Orbiwise OTA"><br/><br/></p>

#### Personalized

After selecting the **Registration type** > **Personalized** option, the list of fields will update to show you required fields needed for **Personalized** registraiton. This registration process is similar to *Activation by Personalization* that may see with other LoRa networks. You will need to fill in all require fields to register & activate your device with OrbiWise. Below you will find notes on the fields seen for Personalized registration and specific notes as they relate to what needs to be selected in order to work with Cayenne.

+ **Device EUI:** Enter the **DevEUI** for your device. This ID should come with the information included with your device, or can be found in the device configuration.
+ **Application EUI:** Enter the **AppEUI**. The AppEUI is a global application ID that uniquely identifies the application provider (i.e., owner) of the device.

   *TIP: If you do not have an Applicate EUI, you can create one yourself. It must be a unique string composed of 16 alphanumeric characters.*
+ **Comment:** Optional. We recommend you enter in the device name, or a description so that you can easily refer to it on the OrbiWise dashboard.
+ **DevAddr:** When using Personalized registration, you will need to manually enter the 4 byte hardware address here.
+ **NwkSKey:** Enter the **NwkSKey**. The NwkSKey is a network session key specific for the end-device. It is used by both the network server and the end-device to calculate and verify the MIC (message integrity code) of all data messages to ensure data integrity. It is further used to encrypt and decrypt the payload field of a MAC only data messages.
+ Complete the device creation by clicking the **Add Device** button.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://www.mydevices.com/cayenne/uploads/OrbiWise-Add-new-device-Personalized.png" width="600" height="344" alt="Orbiwise ABP"><br/><br/></p>

### Setup device forwarding to Cayenne

In order for data from your device to reach Cayenne, you must configure forwarding from within the settings found in your user-specific OrbiWise portal. You only need to perform this step once from the portal. To set this up, open the **Applications** menu and select **HTTP Push configuration**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170613142142/OrbiWise-Applications-menu.png" width="600" height="86" alt="Orbiwise Push menu"><br/><br/></p>

From the *HTTP Push configuration* screen we find the settings needed to forward data to Cayenne. To set this up, enter the following information:

1. **Hostname:** ``https://lora.mydevices.com``
2. **Port:** ``443``
3. **Path prefix:** ``/v1/networks/ubiq/uplink``
4. **Host Username:** *Enter anything you want here. OribiWise requires this field, but it is not used by Cayenne.*
5. **Host Password:** *Enter anything you want here. OribiWise requires this field, but it is not used by Cayenne.*
6. Click on the **Start** button to start the forwarding service.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170613143613/OrbiWise-Push-configuration.png" width="600" height="480" alt="Orbiwise Cayenne push configuration"><br/><br/></p>

###  Programming the device

Some devices will come from your device supplier preprogrammed and ready to be used immediately. Other devices will require you to program the device manually. If your device is preprogrammed, it can now be deployed and connected to the network for usage.

If your device needs to be programmed, you should now proceed with programming/flashing the device. Because this process is different for each device, you should refer to the instructions for your device for any specific information you need to perform this step. If you need help, you can refer to the [Supported devices section](#supported-hardware-lora-technology-devices) where you will find Product page, Datasheet and User Guides for your device.

**NOTE: Be sure that your device is programmed and properly connected to the network at this time. Only after your device is programmed, online and properly forwarding data should you proceed with adding your device to Cayenne.**

_TIP: You should see data being reported on the OrbiWise portal's **Data** > **Show Packets** page. If you do not, double check the values entered for your device and consider programming/flashing the device again._

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://www.mydevices.com/cayenne/uploads/OrbiWise-Data-packet-activity.png" width="600" height="344" alt="Orbiwise data activity"><br/><br/></p>

### Add device to Cayenne

Once your device has been registered, programmed, and connected to a gateway that is forwarding data to Cayenne, you can proceed with adding the device in Cayenne so that it appears in your dashboard.

From the Cayenne dashboard, click **Add New** > **Device / Widget**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160601122359/AddNew.jpg" width="200" height="192" alt="Orbiwise"><br/><br/></p>

You can find links to an appropriate version of this device on the <a href="http://multitech.com/brands/multiconnect-conduit" target="_blank">Multitech MultiConnect Conduit page</a>.

**Be sure that your devices are covered by the Senet network, including having an appropriate gateway configured and working if needed, before continuing. Your devices will not be able to properly function without your gateway device in place.**

#### Register new gateway device

If you need to register a new gateway device, the Senet portal has instructions and the software for doing so. To begin this process, log into your Senet account and click on the **Register Devices** button. Select **Gateway** from the dialog that appears to begin the process of adding your gateway device.

**Note:** Currently only the MultiTech Conduit gateway can be registered through the Senet Portal.

5. Click **Save** to save the changes.


###  Programming the device

Some devices will come from your device supplier preprogrammed and ready to be used immediately. Other devices will require you to program the device manually. If your device is preprogrammed, it can now be deployed and connected to the network for usage.

If your device needs to be programmed, you should now proceed with programming/flashing the device. Because this process is different for each device, you should refer to the instructions for your device for any specific information you need to perform this step. If you need help, you can refer to the [Supported devices section](#supported-hardware-lora-technology-devices) where you will find Product page, Datasheet and User Guides for your device.

**NOTE: Be sure that your device is programmed and properly connected to the network at this time. Only after your device is programmed, online and properly forwarding data should you proceed with adding your device to Cayenne.**

*TIP: You should see data being reported on the Senet portal's device list for your device. If you do not, double check the values entered for your device and consider programming/flashing the device again.*

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170412135622/Senet-device-traffic.png" width="600" height="358" alt="Senet dashboard showing traffic from device"><br/><br/></p>


### Add device to Cayenne

Once your device has been registered, programmed, configured to forward data to Cayenne and is online, you can proceed with adding the device in Cayenne so that it appears in your dashboard.

From the Cayenne dashboard, click **Add New** > **Device / Widget**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160601122359/AddNew.jpg" width="200" height="192" alt="Senet"><br/><br/></p>

After selecting the device that you wish to add, settings for that device will appear. In the following section, we’ll walk you through the settings needed for adding a previously registered device.

#### Already Registered

Once your device has been previously registered on the Senet network, it can be quickly & easily added to Cayenne. Once added, your device and all of its sensors will appear in your dashboard.

**Items you will need:**

1.  Which [LoRa technology device](#lora-senet-network-supported-devices) is being added?
2.  Your device will need to have been previously registered on the network. Refer to [Manual device registration](#lora-senet-network-manual-register-device) if you need help with manually registering your device on the network.
3.  What is the unique [DevEUI](#lora-about-deveuis) for the device being added?
4.  What is your unique Senet account API Key?

To see how easy it is, let’s walk through an example of connecting an [Multitech mDotBox](#supported-hardware-lora-devices-multitech-multitech-mdotbox) which was previously registered under a [Senet account](#lora-senet-network-create-account).

**1\. Choose the Network** <br/>
Make sure the **Senet** network is selected in the list of Networks.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://www.mydevices.com/cayenne/uploads/Add-LoRa-device-Senet-menu-1.png" width="600" height="362" alt="Senet"><br/><br/></p>

**2\. Select the Device** <br/>
Select your device from among the list supported Senet devices. In this case, we’ll select the **Multitech mDotBox**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://www.mydevices.com/cayenne/uploads/Add-LoRa-device-mDotBox-selected.png" width="600" height="362" alt="Senet"><br/><br/></p>

**3\. Enter Settings & Add device** <br/>
In order to add the device, Cayenne needs to know some information about the device and how it will be shown on the dashboard.

1.  Give the device a name. In our case, we’ll enter “mDotBox” in the **Name** field.
2.  Enter the [DevEUI](#lora-about-deveuis) for this device into the **DevEUI** field.
3.  Our device has been previously manually registered with Senet. Make sure “Already Registered” is selected in the **Activation Mode** field.
4.  Enter your unique **Senet Account API Key** for your Senet account. This will allow Cayenne to send downlink commands to your device.

    *TIP: If you have not generated your API Key it can be found on the Senet Portal under your Account Information.*
  
    **Note: Once generated on the Senet Portal, your API key is not shown to you again. Be sure to copy & save off your API key for later reference! Failing to do so may cause you to need to regenerate your key. If you do so, remember that you will need to update the settings for all previously added devices in Cayenne as well.**
  
    <p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170412143938/Senet-Access-Account-Info.png" width="600" height="213" alt="Senet access Account Info"><br/><br/></p>

    <p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170412150043/Senet-API-Key.png" width="600" height="377" alt="Senet portal showing API key section"><br/><br/></p>

###  Programming the device

Some devices will come from your device supplier preprogrammed and ready to be used immediately. Other devices will require you to program the device manually. If your device is preprogrammed, it can now be deployed and connected to the network for usage.

If your device needs to be programmed, you should now proceed with programming/flashing the device. Because this process is different for each device, you should refer to the instructions for your device for any specific information you need to perform this step. If you need help, you can refer to the [Supported devices section](#supported-hardware-lora-technology-devices) where you will find Product page, Datasheet and User Guides for your device.

**NOTE: Be sure that your device is programmed and properly connected to the network at this time. Only after your device is programmed, online and properly forwarding data should you proceed with adding your device to Cayenne.**

### Add device to Cayenne

Once your device has been registered, programmed, configured to forward data to Cayenne and is online, you can proceed with adding the device in Cayenne so that it appears in your dashboard.

From the Cayenne Dashboard, click **Add New** > **Device / Widget**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="http://d1nocd4j7qtmw4.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/20160601122359/AddNew.jpg" width="260" height="252" alt="Cayenne Add New menu"><br/><br/></p>

After selecting the device that you wish to add, settings for that device will appear. In the following section, we’ll walk you through the settings needed for adding a previously registered device.

#### Already Registered

If your device has been previously registered on the Stream network, it can be quickly & easily added to Cayenne. Once added, your device and all of its sensors will appear in your dashboard.

**Items you will need:**

1. Which [LoRa technology device](#lora-stream-network-supported-devices) is being added?
2. Your device will need to have been previously registered on the network. Refer to [Manual device registration](#lora-stream-network-manually-register-device) if you need help with manually registering your device on a network.
3. What is the unique [DevEUI](#lora-about-deveuis) for the device being added?

To see how easy it is, let’s walk through an example of connecting an [Adeunis Pulse](#supported-hardware-lora-devices-adeunis-adeunis-pulse) which was previously registered under a [the Stream network account](#lora-stream-network-create-account).

**1\. Choose the Network**

Make sure the **Stream** network is selected in the list of LoRaWAN Networks.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420123748/Cayenne-Stream-network-list.png" width="660" height="415" alt="Cayenne showing supported Stream devices"><br/><br/></p>

**2\. Select the Device**

Select your device from among the list of supported Stream network devices. In this case, we’ll select the **Adeunis Pulse**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170420123843/Cayenne-Stream-Pulse-selected.png" width="660" height="414" alt="Stream with Pulse device highlight"><br/><br/></p>

**3\. Enter Settings & Add device**

In order to add the device, Cayenne needs to know some information about the device and how it will be shown on the dashboard.

## The Things Network

**About The Things Network**

The Things Network is building a global, open, crowd-sourced Internet of Things data network which is owned and operated by its users. It is based on the technology called LoRaWAN which is perfect for the Internet of Things as it is low energy, long range and low bandwidth. The entire city of Amsterdam was covered with this network in less than 6 weeks and inspired hundreds of cities around the world to do the same.


**Using The Things Network with Cayenne**

Cayenne makes it easy to use your LoRa device and The Things Network. You will need to:

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dctlrnwuz/image/upload/v1623955958/cayenne/screencapture-eu1-cloud-thethings-network-console-gateways-add-2021-06-18-00_22_27.png" width="660" height="414" alt="Console screen with gateways highlight"><br/><br/></p>


You will then be guided through setting up your gateway device.

*TIP: The Things Network has in-depth documentation on <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/gateways/registration.html" target="_blank">registering your gateway</a> available if you should need help with this process.*

### Create Application

In order for data from your device to reach Cayenne, you must configure your devices in The Things Network portal to forward data to Cayenne. The Things Network portal groups devices in what they call **Applications**. If you want to use a group of devices with Cayenne, you will need to configure your Application to use the Cayenne. You only need to perform this step once for each Application that you want to use.

To create an application, click <a href="https://eu1.cloud.thethings.network/console/applications" target="_blank">add application</a> in the console. The *Add Application* screen appears.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dctlrnwuz/image/upload/v1623957423/cayenne/screencapture-eu1-cloud-thethings-network-console-applications-2021-06-18-00_46_20.png" width="660" height="343" alt="Add Application screen"><br/><br/></p>


On the *Add Application*, fill in the required information to create your new Application.

*Tip: If you need help with this part of the process, you can refer to The Things Network <a href="https://www.thethingsnetwork.org/docs/applications/add.html" target="_blank">documentation on this step</a>.*

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dctlrnwuz/image/upload/v1623957544/cayenne/screencapture-eu1-cloud-thethings-network-console-applications-add-2021-06-18-00_48_46.png" width="660" height="396" alt="Add Application screen"><br/><br/></p>

Once you have an application that you want to use, you can then proceed with configuring it to work with Cayenne.

#### Add Cayenne Integration

To configure your Application to forward data to Cayenne you will need to add an **Integration**. To add the Cayenne integration, perform the following steps:


1. Open your existing Application in the console.
   
2. Select **Integrations** from the left menu.

    <p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dctlrnwuz/image/upload/v1623957712/cayenne/screencapture-eu1-cloud-thethings-network-console-applications-new-app-49-2021-06-18-00_49_50.png" width="660" height="415" alt="Application screen with Integrations highlight"><br/><br/></p>

5. Select the cayenne integeration from the list.


    <p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dctlrnwuz/image/upload/v1623958306/cayenne/screencapture-eu1-cloud-thethings-network-console-applications-new-app-49-integrations-webhooks-add-template-2021-06-18-00_59_39.png" width="660" height="393" alt="Cayenne integration screen with filled in values"><br/><br/></p>
    
6. Complete the Cayenne integration by adding the **Webhook ID** . The *Client ID* (optional) can be left blank.

    <p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dctlrnwuz/image/upload/v1623960449/cayenne/screencapture-eu1-cloud-thethings-network-console-applications-new-app-49-integrations-webhooks-add-template-cayenne-2021-06-18-01_02_58.png" width="660" height="393" alt="Cayenne integration screen with filled in values"><br/><br/></p>

### Registering device on The Things Network
You can register a device to TTN either **From the LoRaWAN Device Repository** or **Manually**.

#### 1. **From the LoRaWAN Device Repository**


For many LoRaWAN devices, the LoRaWAN device repository offers device profiles, LoRaWAN metadata, codecs, and more. When you utilise the device repository to add devices to The Things Stack, the relevant LoRaWAN version and regional parameters version are automatically used, which means you'll have less information to search!

Make sure the From the LoRaWAN Device Repository tab is selected to use the device repository. Then choose your device's Brand, Model, Hardware Version, Software Version, and Region.

Select a Frequency plan that is suited for your area. To communicate, your device and gateway must use the same frequency plan.

If your manufacturer has supplied a JoinEUI/AppEUI, enter it. If your device is programmable, you can utilise all 0s and then programme the device with the same JoinEUI/AppEUI.

Fill in your DevEUI.

Enter an AppKey if your manufacturer supplies one. Otherwise, make one with the generate button and programme it into your device.

Finally, give your device a unique End device ID and register it by clicking the Register end device button.

The device is now active, and once it sends an uplink, it will display as linked in The Things Stack.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dctlrnwuz/image/upload/v1624024135/cayenne/screencapture-eu1-cloud-thethings-network-console-applications-new-app-49-devices-add-repository-2021-06-18-19_18_35.png" width="660" height="414" alt="Account Sign Up"><br/><br/></p>

#### 2. **Manually**

You can manually register your device if it isn't in the device repository.

Make sure you're on the Manually tab.

Select the Activation Mode from the drop-down menu.

Choose the LoRaWAN device version.

Tick the External Join Server button if you're using Over-the-Air-Activation (OTAA) and an External Join Server.

The addresses for the Network Server, Application Server, and Join Server should all point to the same address as the The Things Stack deployment you're using.

To get to the Basic Settings page, click the Start button.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dctlrnwuz/image/upload/v1624029166/cayenne/screencapture-eu1-cloud-thethings-network-console-applications-new-app-49-devices-add-manual-2021-06-18-20_42_20.png" width="660" height="414" alt="Account Sign Up"><br/><br/></p>

Assign a unique End device ID to your device.

If your manufacturer has supplied a JoinEUI/AppEUI, enter it. If your device is programmable, you can utilise all 0s and then programme the device with the same JoinEUI/AppEUI.

Fill in your DevEUI.

The Name and Description fields are optional and will aid in identifying your device.

To go to the next page, click Network Layer Settings.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dctlrnwuz/image/upload/v1624029283/cayenne/screencapture-eu1-cloud-thethings-network-console-applications-new-app-49-devices-add-manual-steps-2021-06-18-20_44_33.png" width="660" height="414" alt="Account Sign Up"><br/><br/></p>

Select a Frequency plan that is suited for your area. To communicate, your device and gateway must use the same frequency plan.

Select the Regional Parameters version offered by your device's manufacturer. Regional Parameters or PHY Version should be mentioned in the data sheet.

You can use the checkboxes to enable Class B or Class C capabilities if your device supports them.

Advanced parameters for configuring Frame counter width and RX2 settings are also available, however they should not be essential for most devices.

To get to the next page, click the Join settings button.


<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dctlrnwuz/image/upload/v1624038990/cayenne/screencapture-eu1-cloud-thethings-network-console-applications-new-app-49-devices-add-manual-steps-2021-06-18-20_47_39.png" width="660" height="414" alt="Account Sign Up"><br/><br/></p>

Enter an AppKey if your manufacturer offers one. Otherwise, make one with the Create button and programme it into your device.

Advanced options for Net ID, Application Server ID, and KEK Labels are also available, but they are not required for most devices.

Finally, to register the end device, click Add end device.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dctlrnwuz/image/upload/v1624039105/cayenne/screencapture-eu1-cloud-thethings-network-console-applications-new-app-49-devices-add-manual-steps-2021-06-18-23_28_16.png" width="660" height="414" alt="Account Sign Up"><br/><br/></p>

### Add device to Cayenne

Once your device has been registered, programmed, configured to forward data to Cayenne and is online, you can proceed with adding the device in Cayenne so that it appears in your dashboard.

From the Cayenne Dashboard, click **Add New** > **Device / Widget**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dctlrnwuz/image/upload/v1624043836/cayenne/Screenshot_2021-06-19_at_12.46.47_AM.png" width="560" height="252" alt="Cayenne Add New menu"><br/><br/></p>

###  Programming the device

Some devices will come from your device supplier preprogrammed and ready to be used immediately. Other devices will require you to program the device manually. If your device is preprogrammed, it can now be deployed and connected to the network for usage.

If your device needs to be programmed, you should now proceed with programming/flashing the device. Because this process is different for each device, you should refer to the instructions for your device for any specific information you need to perform this step. If you need help, you can refer to the [Supported devices section](#supported-hardware-lora-technology-devices) where you will find Product page, Datasheet and User Guides for your device.

**NOTE: Be sure that your device is programmed and properly connected to the network at this time. Only after your device is programmed, online and properly forwarding data should you proceed with adding your device to Cayenne.**

### Add device to Cayenne

Once your device has been registered, programmed, configured to forward data to Cayenne and is online, you can proceed with adding the device in Cayenne so that it appears in your dashboard.

From the Cayenne Dashboard, click **Add New** > **Device / Widget**.

From the list of devices & widgets that appears, select the **LoRa** category and then **The Things Network** option to view a list of supported devices.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170419092744/Cayenne-TTN-supported-devices.png" width="660" height="415" alt="Cayenne showing supported TTN devices"><br/><br/></p>

After selecting the device that you wish to add, settings for that device will appear. In the following section, we’ll walk you through the settings needed for adding a previously registered device.

#### Already Registered

If your device has been previously registered on The Things Network, it can be quickly & easily added to Cayenne. Once added, your device and all of its sensors will appear in your dashboard.

**Items you will need:**

1. Which [LoRa technology device](#lora-the-things-network-supported-devices) is being added?
2. Your device will need to have been previously registered on the network. Refer to [Manual device registration](#lora-the-things-network-manually-register-device) if you need help with manually registering your device on a network.
3. What is the unique [DevEUI](#lora-about-deveuis) for the device being added?

To see how easy it is, let’s walk through an example of connecting an [Adeunis Pulse](#supported-hardware-lora-devices-adeunis-adeunis-pulse) which was previously registered under a [The Things Network account](#lora-the-things-network-create-account).

**1\. Choose the Network**

Make sure **The Things Network** is selected in the list of Networks.

**2\. Select the Device**

Select your device from among the list supported The Things Network devices. In this case, we’ll select the **Adeunis Pulse**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170419092906/Cayenne-TTN-Pulse-highlighted.png" width="660" height="416" alt="TTN with Pulse device highlight"><br/><br/></p>

**3\. Enter Settings & Add device**

In order to add the device, Cayenne needs to know some information about the device and how it will be shown on the dashboard.

1. Give the device a name. In our case, we’ll enter “LoRa Pulse” in the **Name** field.
2. Enter the [DevEUI](#lora-about-deveuis) for this device into the **DevEUI** field.
3. Our device has been previously manually registered with The Things Network. Make sure “Already Registered” is selected in the **Activation Mode** field.
4. Click **Add device**.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/cloudfront-mydevices-wordpress/wp-content/uploads/20170419092952/Cayenne-TTN-Pulse-settings.png" width="660" height="413" alt="TTN Pulse settings"><br/><br/></p>

The Pulse has been added to your dashboard and Cayenne will automatically add widgets for the sensors on the device. You can now [track the location](#features-asset-tracking) of your device as well as examine the current status of the water, gas, electricity & heat sensors on the device.

## Helium

**About Helium**

The Helium Blockchain is building the largest LoRaWAN network within the US. Helium is the first peer-to-peer wireless network that provides secured and low-power Internet of Things communication. It's simple and easy to integrate devices with Helium and Cayenne. 

**Using Helium with Cayenne**

Cayenne makes it easy to use your LoRa device and Helium. You will need to:

1. [Create / Log into your account on Helium Console](#lora-helium-create-account)
2. [Register your device on Helium](#lora-helium-manually-register-device)
3. [Create and configure Integration](#lora-helium-create-application)
4. [Add your device to your Cayenne dashboard](#lora-helium-add-device-to-cayenne)

We will walk you through these steps in the following sections.

### Create or Log into your account

To create your account, visit Helium Console <a href="https://console.helium.com/register" target="_blank">Register</a> page. From here you can enter in all the required details for creating your account. Or you can <a href="https://console.helium.com">Login</a> straight into your account.

### Create and configure Integration

In order for data from your device to reach myDevices, you must configure an integration in the Helium Console. 

To create an integration click on *Integrations*, then select myDevices Cayenne.

The only information you'll need once you've selected your device is to enter the **DevEUI**, which is found on your device details page on Console,  shown below.

<p style="text-align:center"><br/><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/dctlrnwuz/image/upload/v1586192145/ConsoleUnderlineDevEui_iugs0x.png" width="660" height="250" alt="myDevices Cayenne Integration"><br/><br/></p>

Once the device has been added to the dashboard and send a data uplink, the Cayenne dashboard will automatically create the widgets and values coming from the device.
